                    I like challenges becuase they helps me focus on my goals. <br>
                    I used to wonder that why everyone
                    gives importance to computers more than human for day to day works.
                    My early years of education was achived from inexpansive and
                    lower-level education system schools where I never got chance to learn anything about computers.
                    I still wanted to learn, so I challenged myself to study
                    about Computers in University to find answers to my questions.
